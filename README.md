# Data Analysis & Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my collection of data analytics and machine learning projects.  
This repository contains hands-on, exploratory, and structured coding exercises that demonstrate
my growing skills in data science, Python programming, and machine learning.

Each folder in this repository contains a standalone project or code-along exercise, complete with
datasets, code, and explanations.
